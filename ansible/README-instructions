The infar_for_ansible_labs is the folder having the code for the infrastructre that is required for the infar_for_ansible_labs
ie. 2 Linux VMs and 1 Windows VMs

We will be using the same infra for all the ansible labs. So instead of writing it for each lab, I kept it in 
this folder.

You only need to change the Resource Group name in the root's main.tf. For eg. for lab 8 you can name it ResourceGroup-Lab08, for lab 9 you can name it ResourceGroup-Lab09 etc.

Steps:
1. Delete the .terraform folder and .terraform lock file.
2. Change the Resource group name in root's main.tf
3. run terraform init ( You may need have to create backend too [for which instructions are in backend_commands file under  Extras folder ])
4. terraform apply -auto-approve
5. terraform destroy -auto-approve (after lab is done)
